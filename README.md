# SQL-Database-Project_SMITE
This is a project I completed for my third year module Information Management II. 

The project consists of a pdf report outlining a 6 table Relationship model of a snippet of a game I played called Smite.
It addresses, Security, Semantic Constraints, Views, Triggers and the creation and population of a MYSQL database

SQL Scripts are also available along with some diagrams
